%% We have a truncated matrix.  Now we'll create a reduced order model.
% Steps from Slack.
% Let Q denote the first r columns of U and P = QQ^T. 
% Let u' = F(u) denote the Lorenz '96 system and consider the reduced order 
% model v' = G(v) where v = Q^T u and G(v) = Q^T F(Q v). 
%
% Let w = Q v so that w = QQ^T u.
% Note that the IC for v is v(0)=Q^T u(0). 
% Then compare the solution u to the original Lorenz '96 system with the 
% solution to the reduced order model (but comparing w = Q v with the 
% original variable u).

rng(1331); % set a random number seed for consistent simulations.

Q = U_r;            % Let Q denote the first r columns of U
P = Q*transpose(Q);  %  and P = QQ^T.

w = Q*v;

% Are we running a differential equation for the reduced order model?

% u' = F(u) -> Pu' = PF(Pu), P=QQ^T -> Q^T u' = Q^T F(QQ^T u) and let 
% v = Q^T u -> v' = Q^T F(Q v) = G(v) where G(v) = Q^TF(Q v)
% u' = F(u) + Noise (Physical Model). 
% The idea with projected models is to replace the physical model 
% with a projected model: v' = G(v) + P*Noise (Projected physical model in continuous time).
%
% In discrete time: u_{n+1} = F(u_n) + Noise -> Pu_{n+1} = PF(P u_n) + P*Noise 
% and if P = Q Q^T, then Q^T u_{n+1} = Q^T F(Q Q^T u_n) + Q^T*Noise. 
% Let v_n = Q^T u_n, so v_{n+1} = Q^T F(Q v_n) + Q^T*Noise
% u' = F(u) is Lorenz '96. Evolve from u(0) = e_1 Then evolve using P_r = Q_r Q_r^T, 
% i.e., v_r' = G(v_r), v_r(0) = Q_r^T u(0) for r -> N=40 to see how the results compare. 
% Plot w_r(t) = Q_r v_r(t)
% Start with r=40. In this case u and w_r should basically agree. 
% For smaller r we are losing information but hopefully not too badly.
